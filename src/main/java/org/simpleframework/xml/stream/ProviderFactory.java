 * The <code>ProviderFactory</code> object is used to instantiate a
 * provider of XML parsing to the framework. This scans the classpath
 * for the classes required for StAX, if they are present then this 
 * is what will be used to process XML. If however StAX can not be
 * used then a DOM implementation is provided. A DOM provider as a
 * default suits most Java profiles as it is a very common parser.
